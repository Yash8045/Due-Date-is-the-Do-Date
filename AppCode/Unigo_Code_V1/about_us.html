      <h1>About Ride Share</h1>
      <p class="about-us-content">Ride Share is a platform that connects riders and drivers in a university community. Our goal is to make transportation more efficient and affordable for students and faculty, while also providing an opportunity for individuals to earn money by driving. 
      </p>
      <p class="about-us-content">
      The website will have two types of users: riders and drivers. Riders will be able to search for available rides, view driver profiles, and book a seat. Drivers will be able to set their own schedules, view their ride history, and earn money. Both riders and drivers will be able to rate each other, creating a sense of accountability and trust within the community.
      </p>
      <p class="about-us-content">
      In addition, we plan to integrate a carpooling feature, where a group of riders going in the same direction can share a ride and split the cost. This will further reduce transportation expenses for students and faculty.
      </p>
      <p class="about-us-content">
      We believe that our platform will not only improve transportation options, but also foster a sense of community and sustainability within the university.
      Ride Share is a platform that connects riders and drivers in a university community. The goal of our project is to make transportation more efficient and convenient for students and faculty by allowing them to share rides. This not only saves them money on transportation costs, but also helps reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions on campus. Our website will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily search for and book rides, as well as sign up to drive and earn money on their own schedule. 
      We believe that Ride Share will have a positive impact on the university community and the environment.
