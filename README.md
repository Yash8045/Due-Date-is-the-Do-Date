## Project Idea

The University of Regina community, including students and faculty, faces challenges with their daily commutes, such as dependence on time-consuming public transportation, unreliability due to weather conditions, and long waiting times during Saskatchewan winters. To address these concerns, we propose the development of a web-based application that facilitates carpooling and ride-sharing among the university community. This not only lessens the carbon footprint but also allows the car owner to earn a small amount.

## Background
The University of Regina has a large number of students and faculty who depend on public transportation for their commute. This can result in long waiting times, rush hour congestion, and unreliability due to weather conditions.

## Business Need/Opportunity
UniGo provides a solution to the challenges of public transportation by offering a more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective mode of transportation. With UniGo, users can share their commute with others, reducing their carbon footprint and earning a small income.
