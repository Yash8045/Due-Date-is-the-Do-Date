# Project Idea

The goal is to address the concern of commuting to and from the University of Regina. As we know there are a large number of students and faculty who depend on public transport for their commute. Using public transport can be very time-consuming. In addition to this, there are also some other challenges such as unreliability due to weather conditions, rush hour congestion, and long waiting times in Saskatchewan winters.

To address these challenges, we plan to develop a web application that will provide the university faculty and students with the opportunity to share the commute with other users, and thus, lessen their carbon footprint.

How this will work, is that someone with access to a vehicle can provide the option of ride share with someone who lacks the access, while simultaneously getting the opportunity to make a small earning through the rider.
